# Project: Effect of Vaccines on Covid-19 fatality in Colombia
*Data analysis project about the effect of vaccines on covid-19 fatality in Colombia.*

## Overview
- A data analysis on Covid-19 in Colombia was made in order to understand the effects that mass vaccination is having on the lethality of the virus. The main objective is to understand if there really is any positive effect on the vaccinated population.
- Two datasets were used: Covid-19 positive cases data in Colombia extracted from the oficial repository of the National Institute of Health (up to July 14, 2021), and Vaccination data extracted from the official Our World in Data repository. Final datasets with 4.5M and _ respectively.
- Project tools: SQL Server and ADS for loading and cleaning data. SQL and Python for exploratory analysis on a jupyter notebook via %sql magic (ipython-sql).
- It was found that during the first 3 months after the start of vaccination (02-2021), there is no significant change that indicates a decrease in lethality, however, from 05-2021 there is a notable decrease. It is much more evident in the more advanced age groups since they were a priority in the country's vaccination scheme.
